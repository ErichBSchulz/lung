# lung
Lung and Ventilation Models to support the [VentOS project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zuPdXqJ_gFg4drvJkdByst1vagz60usFGL3S3l_cO4A/edit?usp=sharing).

Broadly the notebooks, and python codes, provide the following functionality:

* a rudimentary lung and ventilator model (currently only capable of generating PCV traces)
* code for generating test traces, complete with noise, and mocking of signals from dual pressure and flow sensors
* applying signal processing filters to test traces


## notes to self

This is the standard python nomenclature for packaging:

* modules: named by filenames (lowercase, with underscores)
* packages: named by their directory name (lowercase, without underscores)
